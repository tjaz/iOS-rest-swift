# iOS-rest-swift goals:

1. Create a new project (use ObjectiveC or Swift- preferred)

2. Setup 2 Xcode targets, where one sets the application background color to black and the other to blue.

3. When opening the app, show a list of all Java developers.

Use the Github API to get the users

Load maximum 10 users at once (paging!).
Each user item should contain at least:

registration date
* Bonus: order by username
