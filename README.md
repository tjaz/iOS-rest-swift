# iOS-rest-swift goals:

1. Create a new project (use ObjectiveC or Swift- preferred)

2. Setup 2 Xcode targets, where one sets the application background color to black and the other to blue.

3. When opening the app, show a list of all Java developers.

Use the Github API to get the users

Load maximum 10 users at once (paging!).
Each user item should contain at least:

username
avatar
registration date
* Bonus: order by username

4. Show a more detailed screen of the user, when you click on a user item.

Feel free to add any details you want.
Mandatory details are the email address (in some cases it is not public, if so then just write "test@test.com") and number of followers.
Position the number of followers on bottom left on tablets on on bottom right on phones.
When clicking on the email address, open the default email app on the device.

5. Create today app extension (widget) that displays the name of random github user that you loaded before (in step 3).
